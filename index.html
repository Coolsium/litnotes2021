<h2>The Trouble with Snowmen</h2>
<p><strong>Father</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Practical</li>
</ul>
<p>The Father is practical as he is able to come up with a solution for a problem he identified(He identified a problem with the snowmen melting after the snow).</p>
<ul>
<li>Resourceful</li>
</ul>
<p>The Father was able to aquire the resources and equipment he needed to execute his plan(getting the cement to build a forever lasting snowman)</p>
<ul>
<li>Patient</li>
</ul>
<p>The Father was patient enough to explain to his son the purpose of his plan. This can be seen in "I'll build you a snowman, And I'll build it to last"</p>
<ul>
<li>Does not quite understand what the child wants</li>
</ul>
<p>Although the Father was able to solve all these problems, in the end he failed to understand what his child really wanted(The Father did not realise his son valued the time with him and the experience of building a snowman) The son resented the fact that the father built an everlasting snowman that served to deprive him of the fun that he experienced while building a snowman out of ice</p>
<p><strong>Feelings towards the Father:</strong></p>
<p>I am dissapointed with the Father to some extent as he did not really take into consideration what his child had felt about the issue, yet I also feel quite sad for him as all of his effort in the end was not only unnapreciated by the son, but also made the son feel certain resentment towards his actions which I feel completely wasted his time and effort.</p>
<ul>
<p><strong>Speaker:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Unappreciative</li>
</ul>
<p>The Speaker was unappreciative of the Father's effort and time into making the snowman, with the intention to let the Speaker be disappointed due to the melting of the handmade snowman.</p>
<ul>
<li>Unfillial</li>
</ul>
<p>The Speaker is unfillial as he did not respect what his Father had put in his effort for and had used very strong derogatory language on what the Speaker's Father has built.</p>
<ul>
<li>Resentful</li>
</ul>
<p>The Speaker feels resentful to concrete snowman the Father had built, as it had deprived him of what he valued, the experience of building the snowman and the time spent with the Father building the snowman.</p>
<p><strong>Feelings towards the Speaker:</strong></p>
<p>I feel disgusted to some extent towards the Speaker, as he completely neglects the idea that the Father had built the concrete snowman with the idea of benefiting the Speaker and the fact that the Speaker uses such strong words against the snowman the the Father had spent his time and effort in building for the Speaker.</p>
<p><strong>Literary Devices:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The permanence of the snowman can be seen in that the ABCB rhyme scheme emphasised the words "LAST" and "CAST". This brings out the fact that the snowman the father made that was cast in cement was gto last a long time as compared to the snowmen made of ice that could only last as long as winter.<li>
<li>Furthermore, the permanence of the snowman is brought out using "Be it sunshine or rain." This brings out the permanence of the snowman as the cement snowman will be able to withstand the elements such as rain or shine unlike the delicate and fragile ice snowmen.<p>
<ul>
<p><strong>Literary Devices</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>ABCB rhyme scheme</li>
<li>Imagery</li>
<li>Alliteration</li>
<li>Simile</li>
<li>"ike an unmarked gravestone" is an example of a simile used. The simile is likening the cement snowman the speaker's father built for him to an unmarked gravestone. This shows that the snowman is the speaker's only reminder of his father who is mentioned to be gone. This also shows that the writer resents the fathers hard work because the snowman is representing a gravestone which connotes negative feelings. Moreover, the use of unmarked implies that the snowman is seen as insignificant or not important.<p>
<li>Personification</li>
</ul>

The Trouble with Snowmen

Father:

Practical

The Father is practical as he is able to come up with a solution for a problem he identified(He identified a problem with the snowmen melting after the snow).

Resourceful

The Father was able to aquire the resources and equipment he needed to execute his plan(getting the cement to build a forever lasting snowman)

Patient

The Father was patient enough to explain to his son the purpose of his plan.

Does not quite understand what the child wants

Although the Father was able to solve all these problems, in the end he failed to understand what his child really wanted(The Father did not realise his son valued the time with him and the experience of building a snowman)

Feelings towards the Father:

I am dissapointed with the Father to some extent as he did not really take into consideration what his child had felt about the issue, yet I also feel quite sad for him as all of his effort in the end was not only unnapreciated by the son, but also made the son feel certain resentment towards his actions which I feel completely wasted his time and effort.

Speaker:

Unappreciative

The Speaker was unappreciative of the Father's effort and time into making the snowman, with the intention to let the Speaker be disappointed due to the melting of the handmade snowman.

Unfillial

The Speaker is unfillial as he did not respect what his Father had put in his effort for and had used very strong derogatory language on what the Speaker's Father has built.

Resentful

The Speaker feels resentful to concrete snowman the Father had built, as it had deprived him of what he valued, the experience of building the snowman and the time spent with the Father building the snowman.

Feelings towards the Speaker:

I feel disgusted to some extent towards the Speaker, as he completely neglects the idea that the Father had built the concrete snowman with the idea of benefiting the Speaker and the fact that the Speaker uses such strong words against the snowman the the Father had spent his time and effort in building for the Speaker.
